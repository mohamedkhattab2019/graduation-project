FLYING TAXI 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An air taxi is a small commercial aircraft which makes short flights on
 demand, In 2001 air taxi operations were promoted in the United States
 by a NASA and aerospace industry study on the potential Small Aircraft
 Transportation System (SATS) and the rise of light-jet aircraft manufacturing,
 the Flying taxi is a direct application of the VTOL which will have a great
 impact in the future, many companies now like: Google,Uber and Audi ,..etc
 invest much money in the self-driving cars and they achieved good steps,
 On the other hand part of this companies in addition to the air transport
 companies think in another way to build a flying vehicle which can carry
 a person from point A and reach point B ,Actually by the start of 2019
 Boeing released their first self-flying taxi which completed it's first
 flight successfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it's obvious now that we are a step far from a new technology in the
 Air transport that will make air transportation not limited for the Traveling
 between countries, it's a new fast growing path which means that we need
 more aerospace engineers who are aware about many concepts like path planning,s
tate estimation, computer vision ,..etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course they are many difficulties face this technology , technical difficulti
es for example the test experiments as it cost too much and other difficulties
 related to the laws and how much people will trust an autonomous flying
 vehicle.

\begin_layout Standard
This year we aim to build an scaled prototype which take in consideration
 a weight of one passenger , We start by build a prototype as in this stage
 our main purpose is to build a software architecture of the flying taxi
 so this prototype which is less cost comparing to a full scale model is
 only used to verify the concept of vision navigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
as we mentioned before the flying taxi is a direct application of the VTOL
 so we need to have a proper background about the VTOL.

\begin_layout Section
The VTOL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft is one that can hover, take
 off, and land vertically.
 This classification can include a variety of types of aircraft including
 fixed-wing aircraft as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered
 rotors.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventiona
l take-off and landing), STOL (short take-off and landing), and/or STOVL
 (short take-off and vertical landing).
 Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to the
 aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion.
 VTOL is a subset of V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing).
 Some lighter-than-air aircraft also qualify as VTOL aircraft, as they can
 hover, takeoff, and land with vertical approach/departure profiles.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Electric and hybrid-electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft eVTOL
 is a technology being used in the quest for fully autonomous passenger
 air vehicles (PAV).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So why VTOL ? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
vertical take off and landing, enables a traveler to travel directly from
 point A to point B, instead of going from point A to an airport in a car
 say, then fly from the airport to another airport, and then drive with
 a car from the other airport to point B.
 Not only in travel is VTOL very useful, in rescue operations as well as
 in military and law enforcement applications it is often

\series bold
Advantages of VTOL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VTOL is challenging.
 It is far more technically difficult than conventional winged flight, but
 in exchange, it has several advantages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Time and fuel savings:
\series default
 Vertical take off and landing enables an aerial vehicle to take off from
 many more locations than an aircraft that requires an airport.
 This means that the journey to and from the airport can be eliminated,
 saving time and fuel, and the researchers in US found out that A person
 in the US lives an average of 17 miles away to the next airport.
 But he lives on average less than 1 mile away from a location that is suitable
 for vertical take-off and landing of a small civilian VTOL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Efficiency and speed:
\series default
 For personal aircraft the the wing is typically constructed with a compromise
 in mind.
 Typically it is desired that personal airplanes can take off and land at
 fairly low speeds such as 100kph , so that they can use small regional
 airfields, for example.
 On the other hand speed and efficiency are desired, but an overly large
 wing is a hindrance to this.
 Since lift (like drag) increases with speed, a very large wing at cruise
 speed generates more lift than needed, requiring the pilot to trim the
 elevator down, causing drag.
 The large wing itself, is also causing drag due to skin friction, and the
 larger it is, the more 'skin' is in contact with the air, the more drag
 is caused, the slower the airplane can fly and the more fuel it burns.
 A VTOL plane can be built such that its wings are optimized strictly for
 speed and efficiency since take off and landing are not handled by the
 wing.
 If the VTOL components in turn do not cause much additional drag, then
 real net drag reductions can be achieved making the plane faster and more
 efficient than even a pure aircraft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Safety: 
\series default
More than 85% of all airplane accidents (and fatalities) happen during their
 conventional take off and landing.
 The initial climb and the final descent are the most dangerous segments
 of a flight.
 An aircraft is safest when cruising at high altitude.
 It is most vulnerable when flying close to the ground or rolling on the
 ground at high speeds because the margin for error and error recovery is
 small to non-existent.
 This is why take off and landings are comparatively dangerous, even on
 airports with their vastly long and empty runways.
 Vertical take off and landing greatly reduces this risk because the plane
 is accelerated and decelerated while high in the air adding margin for
 error and recovery.
 This makes already safe air travel even safer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Different types of VTOL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Rotorcraft , 
\series default
or rotary wing aircraft, are those that use lift generated by rotor blades
 spinning around a central mast, so helicopters, quadcopters and gyrocopters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Powered-lift vehicles 
\series default
are those that take off and land vertically but perform differently from
 rotorcraft when in flight.
 They typically have a more conventional fixed wing plane design.
 Examples include convertiplanes such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, which
 takes off and lands vertically but uses fixed wing lift in normal flight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The future of VTOL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the VTOL aircraft has the potential to change the course of aviation history
 and create a new chapter in modern day travel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A number of firms are developing aircraft that use a VTOL system.
 Despite a flood of recent controversies, ride-sharing app firm Uber has
 pledged to launch its first flying taxis in 2020 using VTOL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Munich-based aviation startup Lilium aims to offer an on-demand flying taxi
 service that it claims will be five times faster than traveling in a car.
 The current prototype is a two-seater aircraft shaped like a conventional
 plane that uses a VTOL system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, Airbus showcased a prototype flying hybrid
 car.
 The modular vehicle can disconnect from it wheels, after which it is picked
 up by a flying set of rotors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Nasa has developed the battery-powered GL-10, which take off and land vertically
 but flies efficiently like a conventional plane.
